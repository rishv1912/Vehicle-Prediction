We don't have much description about the data


Variables 

1.name  
2.year  
3.selling_price  
4.km_driven  
5.fuel  
6.seller_type  
7.transmission  
8.Owner  

We have to predict the price of the vehicles. 
So the target variable or label is "selling_price", all the others variables are features.
